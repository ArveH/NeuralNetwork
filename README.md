## NeuralNetwork

This code was created when I was following a tutorial on YouTube, created by Welch Labs. I googled around a bit, and this was the best one I found (if you want to learn the basics of ML in less than a day). The first video you find here:

I STRONGLY recommend trying to code it yourself.

OBS: Also, you need to know some maths. If you don't understand derivatives, you can forget about it. That's what Gradient Descent is all about, and Gradient Descent is the key to ML.
